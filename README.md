# CFRibbageWEB
*a Genie Framework full stack web app for playing cribbage against CFRibbage*


This app will provide a web-facing interface for playing cribbage against the epsilon-solution calculated by [CFRibbage.jl](https://github.com/richardbuckalew/CFRibbage). It uses the [Genie Framework](https://genieframework.com/).

This is a learning project, and will proceed slowly, starting with the server-side functionality. It will accept a game state as a JSON payload and return CFRibbage's best play, also as JSON.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome! This is my first foray into full stack development.
